@article{toride1993,
	abstract = {Solute transport in the subsurface is often considered to be a nonequilibrium process. Predictive models for nonequilibrium transport may be based either on chemical considerations by assuming the presence of a kinetic sorption process, or on physical considerations by assuming two-region (dual-porosity) type formulations which partition the liquid phase into mobile and immobile regions. For certain simplifying conditions, including steady state flow and linear sorption, the chemical and physical nonequilibrium transport models can be cast in the same dimensionless form. This paper presents a comprehensive set of analytical solutions for one-dimensional nonequilibrium solute transport through semi-infinite soil systems. The models involve the one-site, two-site, and two-region transport models, and include provisions for first-order decay and zero-order production. General solutions are derived for the volume-averaged (or resident) solute concentration using Laplace transforms assuming both first- and third-type inlet conditions, and arbitrary initial conditions, input solute concentrations, and solute production profiles. The solutions extend and generalize existing solutions for equilibrium and nonequilibrium solute transport. The general solutions are evaluated for some commonly used input and initial conditions, and zero-order production profiles. Expressions for the flux-averaged concentration are derived from the general and specific solutions assuming a third-type inlet condition. Typical examples of calculated concentration distributions resulting from several sets of initial and input conditions and zero-order production functions are also presented and briefly discussed.},

Based on the hypothesis (Bear's hypothesis) that only that part of each velocity component is of significance which is either parallel or normal to the mean flow direction, the general form of the dispersion is deduced. The dispersivity becomes a tensor of the fourth rank. It has such symmetry properties that it contains only 36 instead of 81 independent components in the general case of an anisotropic porous medium. In isotropic media there are only two dispersivity constants. The latter result had already been deduced by Nikolaevskii. The connection of the dispersivity tensor with a tensor which had previously been constructed by Bear is demonstrated.},

@article{panday2018,
	abstract = {Abstract A groundwater flow model is typically used to provide the flow field for conducting groundwater solute transport simulations. The advection term of the mass conserved formulation for groundwater transport assumes that the flow field is perfectly balanced and that all water flowing into a numerical grid cell is exactly balanced by outflows after accounting for sources/sinks or internal storage. However, in many complicated regional or site-scale models, there may be localized flow balance errors that may be difficult to eliminate through tighter flow convergence tolerances due to simulation time constraints or numerical limits on convergence tolerances. Thus, if water is erroneously gained or lost within a grid cell during the flow computation, the solutes within it will also be numerically affected in the associated transport simulation. Transport solutions neglect this error in groundwater flow as the transport equations that are solved assume no error in flow. This flow imbalance error can however have consequences on the transport solution ranging from unnoticeable errors in the resulting concentrations to spurious oscillations that can grow in time and hinder further solution. An approach has been suggested here, to explicitly handle these flow imbalances during mass conserved advective transport computations and report them in the corresponding transport mass balance output, as corrections that are needed to handle errors originating in the flow solution. Example problems are provided to explain the concepts and demonstrate the impacts.},

Similar solutions can be found using the Boussinesq approximation. Despite this similarity the corresponding bifurcation diagrams are shown to be topologically not equivalent. This gives rise to serious doubts on the validity of Boussinesq approximation for this model problem. Grid convergence is investigated for the numerically obtained solutions.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to clarify and circumvent the issue of multiple steady state solutions in the Elder problem. A pseudospectral method is used to avoid numerical error associated with spatial discretization. The pseudospectral method is verified by comparison to an analytical solution at Rayleigh number, Ra = 0, and by reproducing the three stable steady state solutions that are known to exist at Ra = 400. A bifurcation diagram for 0 < Ra < 400, which is free of discretization error, confirms that multiple steady states are indeed an intrinsic characteristic of the Elder problem. The existence of multiple steady states makes the Ra = 400 Elder problem less suitable for benchmarking numerical models. To avoid the multiple steady states, we propose a benchmark at Ra = 60. The results for this Low Rayleigh Number Elder Problem are presented and compared to simulations with the commercial groundwater modeling package FEFLOW. Correspondence between the pseudospectral model and FEFLOW is excellent.},

The delta occupies most of the Bengal Basin and is slowly subsiding as a result of isostatic adjustment of the crust due to rise of the Himalayas and dewatering of the Proto-Bengal Fan sediments which is now buried under thick Mio-Pliocene-Pleistocene deltaic sediments. Well-log data from northwest of Dhaka indicates that at least a part of the basin is subsiding at a rate of 2.2 cm/year. Three areas of the basin --- the Hatiya Trough, Faridpur Trough and Sylhet Trough --- may be subsiding at similar or higher rates. Engineering projects that do not consider the subsidence component in planning and designing may produce results detrimental to the environment.},

@article{doi:10.1029/2006WR005195,
	abstract = {Environmental processes frequently exhibit threshold-type behavior, e.g., the initiation of fluxes such as snowmelt, recharge, and quick flow. Incorporating such thresholds into hydrological models introduces discontinuities into the objective functions used in model calibration, making parameter estimation unnecessarily more difficult. Moreover, this study shows that model thresholds can produce spurious multimodality in least squares objective functions even if the underlying model is near linear in its parameters. In contrast, smoothing the model with respect to its parameters and inputs yields differentiable objective functions and, in some cases, can also improve its macroscale characteristics by removing spurious secondary optima. This simplifies model calibration and sensitivity analysis by reducing the complexity of objective functions and permitting the use of powerful derivative-based analysis methods such as Newton-type optimization and Hessian-based uncertainty assessment. This paper details smoothing strategies for several classes of thresholds and discontinuities commonly found in hydrological models, including step and angle discontinuities in the constitutive functions and flux constraints arising from conservation laws in the governing differential equations. The smoothing algorithms and their parameters are selected to ensure infinite differentiability of the model and its objective functions while preserving the macroscale behavior of the original governing equations. The improvements in the structure of the model and its objective functions are illustrated empirically for a degree-day-based snow model. The smoothing techniques are general and can be applied to other models with thresholds.},
